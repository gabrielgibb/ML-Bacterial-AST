# ML-Bacterial-AST
MSci Physics Final Year Project - "Developing a convolutional neural network to perform rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing"

This project aimed to utilise current machine learning techniques to train a model to differentiate between bacteria that are resistant or susceptible to different antibiotics. The images used are in the form of 400 frame videos and were captured using the novel SCFI technique.

Two antibiotics were considered, one bacteriocidal, the other bacteriostatic. Best test classification accuracy obtained was 95.1% for the bacteriostatic agent, and 89.1% for the bacteriostatic agent. Please feel free to contact me for the full report.
